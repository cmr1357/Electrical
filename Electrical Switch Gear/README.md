# Switchgear.

Hi Friends, 

  Let us discuss about switchgear in detail before that.
  
  What is a switch?
  
  It is very simple and everyone knows it! 
  Yes, In elctrical a switch is a device that has the capability to on and off a circuitery.
  
  Now letus discuss about switchgear.
  
  A switchgear is a combination of electrical disconnect switches, fuses or circuit breakers used to control, protect and isolate electrical equipments.
  A normal switch is used to control the low voltage and for higher voltage like 3.3KV or 11Kv we need something higher han switch to control the flow of current.
  A switch gear is used both to de-energize equipment to allow to be done and to clear faults downstream.
  for instant if we have a high power motor and we need to perform some maintenance in the motor. switchgear plays an important role to disconnect the powersupply from the motor when we are working on it.
  Switchgears are used in generation, Transmission and distribution systems, whereas control gears are used in consumer circuits.
  MOstly switchgear are used in higher voltage side.
  
  An Electrical switchgera referes to a centralized collection of circuitbreakers, fuses and switches.
  The circuit protection devices are mounted in metal structure. and a collection of one or more switchgear is called a lineup assembly.
  The switchgear is commonly found throughout electric utility transmission and distribution systems as well as in medium to large sized commertial or industrial facilities.
  
  The standard foer switchgear are IEEE in North America and IEC in Europe and other parts of the world.
  ## How does switchgear work?
  
  As we mentioned earlier an Electrical switchgear refers to a collection of circuit protection devices mounted in a common, metal enclosure. These circuit protection devices such as circuit breakers are used to distribute power to various sections of a facility and the electrical loads within those sections.
  The circuit protection devices also protect people and equipment throughout the facility by limo
 iting the current flow through the system to safe levels.
 ## Differnt type of switchgear available 
 
### Low-voltage metal-enclosed switchgear

A low-voltage metal-enclosed switchgear is a three-phase power distribution product designed to safely, efficiently and reliably supply electric power at coltages upto 1,000amps
